            <h3>
                Hi! My name is Brianna Jansen, I am the owner and massage therapist for Escape & Revitalize
                Massage.
            </h3>
            Wanting to pursue my passion for helping people, I originally attended Tarleton State University to
            become a
            nurse,
            but I decided to change career paths along the way. With the same goal in mind, in 2018, I got my
            massage
            license and have been practicing since.

            <br> <br>

            I whole-heartedly believe that self-care is a huge MUST in the daily hustle and bustle of everyday life.
            I know I'm new to the massage scene, but let my hands do the talking!

            <br> <br>

            I specialize in deep tissue techniques, myofascial release and therapeutic techniques to bring you a
            completely customized session. And for those that want to relax, don't worry I can do swedish for you
            too.
            Hot towels are included in every massage for no extra charge.

            One massage does not fit all and with all the choices out there,
            I appreciate you choosing Escape & Revitalize Massage.
            </p>
