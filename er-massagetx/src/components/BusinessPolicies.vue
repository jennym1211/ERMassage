            <h3>Cancellation Policy</h3>
            Please provide at least 5 hours notice before your appointment that you won't be able to make it.
            Cancellations made within 5 hours before your appointment time will result in a 50% charge.

            <h3>First Appointment Policy</h3>
            If you are a no-call no-show to your first appointment, you <b>WILL</b> lose your first-time discount, and
            you fall under 100% payment under no-call no-show policy.

            <h3>Mask Policy</h3>
            Masks <b><i><u>are not required</u></i></b> at this establishment, however they are highly recommended for
            guests who
            are not
            vaccinated or are immuno-compromised. If you wear a mask, I will wear one too.

        <div class="policy">
            Daily Reminder that you should not come in if you are feeling under the weather! It is easier to cancel your
            appointment and get it filled versus cancelling my entire day.
        </div>
        <div class="policy">
            I <u><b><i>do not</i></b></u> work in the pelvic crease or groin, please do not ask for it. It will not
            happen. Repeated
            offense
            will result in being blacklisted from getting back on my table.

        <h1>FAQ</h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="policy">
            <p class="q"> Q: What is deep tissue?</p>
            <p class="a">A: Deep tissue is not as bad as it sounds! It is a technique, not a depth of pressure. It may
                hurt a little
                bit, but you shouldn't be in more pain than when you came in. It gets to the deeper muscles that are
                causing
                more of the issues to solve them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="policy">
            <p class="q">Q: What can you do in a 60 min session?</p>
            <p class="a"> A: This depends on the type of session you're looking for. Most of my clients have a lot of
                built up pain
                and
                tension, so their hour is for solving the issues and pain. If you're looking for relaxation and nothing
                but
                relaxation, I could easily do a fullbody massage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="policy">
            <p class="q"> Q:How many sessions will I need to solve an issue?</p>
            <p class="a"> A: It depends on the issue and depends on how longs it's been bothering you. Most of my
                clients will start
                to
                feel a little better after the first session, but the pain will come back. Massage is not a one and done
                fix
                all. It takes repetition to start seeing results because of muscle memory.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="policy">
            <p class="q"> Q:What's the difference between massage therapy and chiropractics?</p>
            <p class="a">A: Massage therapy works on the muscles and chiropractic care focus on the skeletal structure.
                They actually
                go
                hand in hand if you're looking for more results!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="policy">
            <p class="q">Q: When is the best time to get a massage? </p>
            <p class="a">A: Ideally, getting a massage is the best at the end of the day after every activity you may
                have.
                I know that's not possible all the time, but even breaks you have in your day are perfect for them. All
                I ask is please don't go workout after getting the lactic acid moved out of your system.</p>

        <div class="policy">
            <p class="q">Q: Will you work on a minor? </p>
            <p class="a">A: Yes, as long as you remain present in the office or room, and they are over the age of 10.
